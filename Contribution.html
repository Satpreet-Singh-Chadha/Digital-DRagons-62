<h1> How you can contribute </h1>
<ol>
   <li><p>Buy energy efficient</p>
    Electrical appliances are becoming more efficient by the year. What’s more, many countries now show how efficient particular products are, meaning you can make an informed choice. Whether it’s buying energy-saving light bulbs or choosing appliances with a high energy star rating, you can make your home more eco-friendly. Additionally, make sure to turn off and unplug anything you’re not using. 
    </li> 
<li><p>Switch to renewables </p>
Energy providers around the world are now offering greener tariffs. By switching to a company that provides electricity from solar, wind, or hydroelectric energy, you can reduce your household emissions and save money on your energy bills. You could even install solar panels if they’re readily available where you live. 
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch off computers </p>
An IT lab with rows of idling computers takes up a lot of energy. You can reduce your school’s energy bills and carbon footprint by keeping electronic devices turned off and unplugged when they’re not in use. 
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to an Electric or Hybrid Car</p>
Don’t rush out and buy a new car if you already have a perfectly serviceable vehicle. However, if you plan on replacing your current car anyway, a fuel-efficient vehicle can make a huge dent in your carbon footprint. An improvement of just 3 miles per gallon in fuel efficiency can save you 3,000 pounds of CO2 annually.[5] Even better, opt for a pre-owned hybrid or fuel-efficient car.
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy Locally-sourced Food</p>
Those roasted Hawaiian macadamia nuts might be delicious, but unless you live on the Big Island, those nuts had to be put on a boat or plane and shipped thousands of miles to get to your local grocery store. Every mile that food has to be transported via boat, plane, train, truck, or car will add to the product’s carbon footprint.
